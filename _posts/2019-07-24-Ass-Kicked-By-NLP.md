title: "NLP and Recurrent Networks are Hard"

Chapter 12 kicked my ass. I think part of it is I'm not in a good learning state. I am pretty tired and dehydrated. I also did not really understand the last chapter to the level to continue. This book is dense and if I want to get through it effectively I need to be able to focus myself. Still I got a fair amount of work done and I think watching the Siraj video on recurrent networks should help. I'm going to take a break for now to watch Stranger Things.
