I recently started reading the book Incognito. The book is recommended reading for aspiring data scientists; the book, however, is about the history and study of neuroscience. I've only completed the first chapter but so far I find the book very interesting, easy to read and very informative. The first chapter covered the Liebnitz, Freud and the emerging idea of the difference between the conscious and unconscious mind. The book is pretty respectful and complimentary of Freud -- which is kind of surprising given that he is so frequently belittled in modern pop culture. Its kind of sad since he did advance scientific thought and had theories of the mind that were far beyond his time. 

I'm hoping the rest of the book is as good. I've been in a rut lately reading pretty unispiring books and even listening to some awful podcasts. Its hard to be so limited with my current reading selection living in Bali.
