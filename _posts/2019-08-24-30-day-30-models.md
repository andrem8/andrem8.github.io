Today is near the end of August. Time in Bali seems to be moving so fast. I'm really happy here but I was hoping I'd have a clearer idea of what I wanted to do next by this time. I think part of it is that I feel I still have a lot to do here and try and learn. 

Anyways, I recently started the Fast.ai course. It takes a top down approach to learning to deep learning. Honestly, the library is very easy to use and transfer learning allows you to create really really good models pretty easy. At this point I'm starting to feel pretty comfortable with deep learning concepts but I just need to put more effort in practicing and creating more models. 

I'm going to challenge myself to do 30 models in 30 days. It seems arbitrary but I need to create more and more models to get better.
