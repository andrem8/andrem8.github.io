I just finished the book "How Smart Machines Think" by Sean Garrish. The book is absolutely fantastic and provides a high level overview of the advances of artificial intelligence in the past 20 years. It covers and explains very well the teams,technologies and structure behind DeepMind, AlphaGo, Watson  and several other important research projects. The most interesting chapter or case study to me was the Netflix Recommendation challenge.
