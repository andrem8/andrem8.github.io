Today is Tuesday and I just finished a chapter from Deep Learning on NLP. The chapter is dense and has a lot to take in. I think I'm going to need to review a few other learnings resources before moving on in the book.

I have a good amount of time to study today because I can't surf or exercise at the moment. I had physical therapy on my shoulder for an inflammed rotator cuff. I think I'll have to stop playing spikeball. It absolutely ruins my shoulder.

Some projects I want to work in the coming weeks:
* Create an app to accept pictures and classify the picture as a cat or not cat
* Create an NLP algo that analyzes the NBA subreddit for common phrases
